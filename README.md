# Thomas Johnson — Clinical Biomechanics & Movement Technology Portfolio

Welcome to the source code for my personal portfolio website  
👉 **https://tdjohnson1987.github.io**

This site showcases selected work across **clinical biomechanics, rehabilitation technology, gait analysis, orthotic innovation, and applied human movement research**.  
I built the site to highlight both my **technical capabilities** (Python, MATLAB, OpenSim, data analysis) and my **clinical experience** in orthotics and rehabilitation.

## About This Portfolio

The website includes:

### **🧐 Research & Academic Work**
- Plantar pressure and rocker-shoe analysis @ KTH Moveability Lab; ISB 2023 presentation (Fukuoka, Japan)
- Digital orthotic evaluation workflows

### **🦶 Clinical & Rehabilitation Practice**
- Orthotic prescription and design
- Neurological & paediatric gait assessment and orthotic prescription
- Education and training for clinicians

### **💻 Technical Projects (with links to code/notebooks)**
### **JumpPro**
**Technologies:** Python, Pandas, Streamlit, SciPy, Matplotlib  
Development of a signal-processing pipeline and exploratory model to detect and quantify jump events in real time using IMU data.  
Completed in collaboration with the Swedish Beach Volleyball Team to support performance monitoring and training feedback.

### **Shoulder Load Monitor**
**Technologies:** React, Swift, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)  
Prototype application that parses and visualises accelerometer and gyroscope data from an IMU to monitor glenohumeral joint activity in real time.  
Designed to support clinicians, coaches, and athletes in understanding shoulder loading patterns during movement.

### **Performance Protocol**
**Technologies:** React, Swift, Core ML, VNDetectHumanBodyPoseRequest  
Performance and communication tool aimed at helping coaches, therapists, and medical staff translate biomechanical and movement insights into clear, actionable guidance for athletes.  
Integrates pose detection and lightweight machine learning models to support movement assessment and decision-making.
